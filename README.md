A python game in process.

My first game. Currently uploaded version was made in one day (the first time I've looked at pygame). New features and even better code organisation to come...

Sketch Plan: 

1 change: I decided to make the timer count in intervals of 1.4 seconds, rather than by 1 second, so the game feels ever so slightly unsettling.
