# the-truth
A python game in process.

My first game. Current version was made in one day. New features and even better code organisation to come...

Sketch Plan: 
(First two boxes, i.e. 2/3 of the first page, have been completed)
1 change: I decided to make the timer count in intervals of 1.4 seconds, rather than by 1 second, so the game feels ever so slightly unsettling.
